SLIM WORKSHOP ONLINE
Version 7

3 March 2021


========================================================


This folder contains online materials for the SLiM Workshop, for those who want to do it themselves rather than attending an in-person workshop.  There are three types of files provided:

    *.key.pdf : PDF files containing the slides for each lecture
    *.mp3 : Audio files providing a voiceover for each lecture
    *.pages.pdf : PDF files for the worksheets, to be done after each lecture

Note that worksheets #7, #8, #22, and #23 have no corresponding lecture; this is intentional.


The home page for the SLiM Workshop is:

    http://benhaller.com/workshops/workshops.html

That page provides more detailed information, including links to software installation instructions, in-person workshops that are scheduled, a link to worksheet solutions, information on how to get help, and so forth.  It is recommended that you read it.

Happy modeling!


Cheers,
-B.
